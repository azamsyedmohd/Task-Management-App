Overview
This project is a Task Management Application built using React and Redux for managing tasks with basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). The tasks can be categorized as "To-Do", "In-Progress", or "Completed", with features to edit and delete tasks. Pop-up modals are used for task editing and notifications are displayed for success or error states.

Features
Add Task: Create a new task with a description and status.
Edit Task: Update the description or status of an existing task.
Delete Task: Remove a task from the list.
Task Status: Tasks can have three statuses:
To-Do
In-Progress
Completed
Pop-up Modal: Tasks are edited via a pop-up modal that centers on the screen.
Bottom Notifications (Toast): Success and error notifications appear at the bottom of the screen after task operations.
